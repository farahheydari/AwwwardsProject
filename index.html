                        <h3>Relationships forged around a communal table</h3>
                        <p>Our first communal table on Rue Dansaert in Brussels was made out of wood recovered 
                            from the floors of Belgian trains that had been taken out of service. Those simple
                             planks became a tradition. Today, this same rough, reclaimed wood continues to bring 
                             rustic comfort to our restaurants, and the communal tables have become our centerpieces.
                              We believe that the community is what nurtures, inspires, and feeds the soul. Our tables 
                              are long enough for all to fit and narrow enough for all to talk; they are where friends
                               reconnect, and new friendships, relationships, and career paths are forged over the shared
                                appreciation of delicious food and good company.  For every new table, the old wood is
                                 planed and sanded until it feels completely smooth, and the surface only gets better
                                  after years of guests’ hands touching it and hosts cleaning it.
